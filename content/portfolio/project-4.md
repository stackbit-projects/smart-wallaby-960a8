The following three plays, written and pefromed between 2009 and 2019, are now collected in a single volume by Dhauli Books, [available on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.in/dp/9389382009?ref=myi_title_dp)

**Hamlet and Angad** (2016): The two titular characters find themselves trapped in a strange, psychological landscape that they struggle to escape. Hamlet and Angad (or people claiming to be them) wrestle with ideas of family and identity in this absurdist adventure that explores the parallels between their incarnations in Shakespeare and the Ramayana. The script won the Hindu Playwright Award 2016. Performed by CreaShakthi in 2019.

**The Uprising** (2013): A satire set in colonial era India where a recently-arrived General bans guns in the fort of Amragaon. The residents instantly rebel and everything goes wrong. Performed by the Eccentrics in August 2013.

**A Play About Death** (2011): An absurdist story of an insufferable play gone wrong, the warping of reality for fun and profit and how the story must always go on â€“ even if the characters have to die twice to make it happen. Performed by Masquerade Youth Theatre in 2011.
